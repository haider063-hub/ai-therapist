# Fixes Applied - Credit System & Voice Chat Flow

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: New Users Receiving 50 Credits Instead of 200

**Problem:**
- New users were receiving 50 credits for both voice and chat instead of the intended 200 credits each
- The display showed 250 (incorrect total)
- Database schema was updated in code but migration was never created

**Root Cause:**
The database schema file (`schema.pg.ts`) was updated with correct defaults (200 credits), but no migration SQL file was created to alter the actual database table. This meant:
- New users got old default values (likely 50 each)
- Existing users weren't updated
- The database structure didn't match the schema definition

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Created migration file: `0005_add_subscription_credit_system.sql`
   - Adds all missing subscription and credit fields to user table
   - Sets correct defaults: 200 for `chat_credits` and 200 for `voice_credits`
   - Updates existing free trial users to have 200 credits each
   - Creates supporting tables: `transaction`, `usage_log`, `mood_tracking`, `subscription_plan`
   - Adds proper indexes for performance

2. ‚úÖ Updated migration journal (`_journal.json`) to include the new migration

**Files Changed:**
- `src/lib/db/migrations/pg/0005_add_subscription_credit_system.sql` (NEW)
- `src/lib/db/migrations/pg/meta/_journal.json` (UPDATED)

### Issue 2: Voice Chat Randomly Selecting Therapist

**Problem:**
- When new users clicked "Voice Chat", they were taken directly to the voice chat page
- A random therapist was selected instead of showing the therapist selection page first
- The flow bypassed the important step of choosing a therapist

**Root Cause:**
The navigation logic in `app-header.tsx` was checking if a therapist existed in browser localStorage (Zustand persist store) instead of properly validating the user's selection. This caused:
- Stale data from browser cache to be used
- Users to skip therapist selection
- Poor user experience for new accounts

**Solution Applied:**

1. ‚úÖ **Fixed Voice Chat Button Navigation** (`app-header.tsx`)
   - Changed logic to ALWAYS go to `/therapists` page first
   - Removed unreliable localStorage check
   - Let the therapist selection page handle the "continue" flow

2. ‚úÖ **Added Redirect Guard** (`voice-chat/page.tsx`)
   - Added `useEffect` hook to check if therapist is selected
   - Automatically redirects to `/therapists` if no therapist is selected
   - Prevents users from accessing voice chat without selecting a therapist

3. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Therapist Selection UX** (`therapist-selection.tsx`)
   - Added banner showing currently selected therapist (if any)
   - Added "Continue to Voice Chat ‚Üí" button for returning users
   - Changed heading from "Choose" to "Change" when therapist already selected
   - Improved user experience for both new and returning users

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/layouts/app-header.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `src/app/voice-chat/page.tsx` (UPDATED)
- `src/components/therapist-selection.tsx` (UPDATED)

## Testing Required

### Before Pushing Code:

1. **Reset Database (RECOMMENDED):**
   ```bash
   cd EchoNest-AI-Theraphy
   npm run db:reset-full
   ```
   
   Wait for the script to complete, then proceed to testing.

2. **Test Credit System:**
   - [ ] Create a new test account
   - [ ] Verify new user gets 200 chat credits
   - [ ] Verify new user gets 200 voice credits
   - [ ] Check credit display shows "200" for each type (not 50 or 250)
   - [ ] Verify total credits calculation is correct

3. **Test Voice Chat Flow:**
   - [ ] Create a new account (clear browser cache first)
   - [ ] Click "Voice Chat" button in header
   - [ ] Verify it goes to `/therapists` page
   - [ ] Select a therapist
   - [ ] Verify it navigates to `/voice-chat` page
   - [ ] Try accessing `/voice-chat` directly without therapist ‚Üí should redirect to `/therapists`

4. **Test Returning User Flow:**
   - [ ] Log in with an account that has a therapist selected
   - [ ] Go to `/therapists` page
   - [ ] Verify banner shows current therapist
   - [ ] Click "Continue to Voice Chat" button
   - [ ] Verify it goes directly to voice chat
   - [ ] Select a different therapist ‚Üí verify it updates correctly

## Database Setup Instructions

You have **TWO OPTIONS** for setting up the database:

### Option 1: üî• FULL DATABASE RESET (RECOMMENDED for Testing Phase)

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL existing data!**

Since you're in testing phase and the credit system has changed significantly, a clean reset is recommended:

```bash
cd EchoNest-AI-Theraphy
npm run db:reset-full
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Drop all existing tables
- ‚úÖ Remove all test users and their data
- ‚úÖ Recreate schema from scratch with correct 200 credit defaults
- ‚úÖ Create all subscription tables
- ‚úÖ Give you a clean slate for testing

**After reset, optionally initialize subscription plans:**
```bash
npm run init-subscription-plans
```

---

### Option 2: Migration Only (Preserve Existing Data)

If you want to keep existing users and just update the schema:

```bash
cd EchoNest-AI-Theraphy
npm run db:migrate
```

**Note:** Existing users will be updated to have 200 credits, but you may have data inconsistencies from the old system.

---

### Verify Database Setup:
```sql
-- Check if new columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'user' 
  AND column_name IN ('chat_credits', 'voice_credits', 'subscription_type');

-- Check credit values for users
SELECT id, email, chat_credits, voice_credits, subscription_type 
FROM "user" 
LIMIT 10;

-- Verify tables exist
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If you used Option 1 (Full Reset):
No rollback needed - the database is already clean. Just run the reset script again if needed.

### If you used Option 2 (Migration):
```sql
-- Rollback script (use with caution)
BEGIN;

-- Drop added columns (only if absolutely necessary)
ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "chat_credits";
ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "voice_credits";
ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "subscription_type";
ALTER TABLE "user" DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS "subscription_status";
-- ... (add other columns as needed)

-- Drop created tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "transaction" CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "usage_log" CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "mood_tracking" CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "subscription_plan" CASCADE;

ROLLBACK; -- or COMMIT if you want to apply
```

**Better Option:** Just run `npm run db:reset-full` to start fresh.

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any problems:
1. Check migration logs for errors
